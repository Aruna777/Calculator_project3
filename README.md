# Calculator_project3

WELCOME NOTE:

I have created a history to display all expressions that have been calculated so far, by extending the previous calculator (project 1) along with square root, mod, addition, subtraction, and division operations. My application is applicable to Windows, Mac OS, and mobile phones.
